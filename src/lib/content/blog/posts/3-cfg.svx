Every developer who works on Linux likely has a plethora of dotfiles used to customize and configure their machine exactly how they want it. Whether it be a .bashrc or a .vimrc these files turn your linux experience from boring and limiting to customized and feature rich. But what happens when we want to bootstrap a new machine, or when we ssh into a server and want all of these dotfiles? We clearly need an effective way to share and sync our dotfiles across systems.

There are many ways to manage dotfiles, previously I have used the bare repositories method. Recently, however, I have swapped to use GNU Stow to facilitate dotfile management. In my opinion GNU Stow in conjunction with git provides the most simple and effective solution for dotfile management.
