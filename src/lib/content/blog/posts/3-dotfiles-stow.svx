Every developer who works on Linux likely has a plethora of dotfiles used to customize and configure their machine exactly how they want it. Whether it be a .bashrc or a .vimrc these files turn your linux experience from boring and limiting to customized and feature rich. But what happens when we want to bootstrap a new machine, or when we ssh into a server and want all of these dotfiles? We clearly need an effective way to share and sync our dotfiles across systems.

There are many ways to manage dotfiles, previously I have used the bare repositories method. Recently, however, I have swapped to use GNU Stow to facilitate dotfile management. In my opinion GNU Stow in conjunction with git provides the most simple and effective solution for dotfile management.

## What is GNU Stow?

If you are looking for a very long and dry read you could read about GNU stow from the [official documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Introduction). But honestly it is not that complicated. Stow is basically justa sym link manager. It importantly it can take thins from one directory and symlinnks them to another target directoy. 

## A Dotfiles Repository

We will want a central place to store our dotfiles. Specifically, a place that can be shared accross machines. The solution is obvious, it is Github. We will make a repository with all our dotfiles in it. Importantly
